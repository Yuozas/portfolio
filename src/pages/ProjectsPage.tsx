The landing and jumping mechanics were intentionally made uncomfortable to represent a more realistic approach to jumping, with an uncomfortable delay. This game feels clunky and served as a good lesson that realism doesn't always equate to fun gameplay. There's a similar jumping concept in Jump King, which I wasn't aware of at the time, and it's equally, if not more, frustrating."

It was taken down, which broke my heart, and I always dreamed of creating my private server. I managed to retrieve the source code and different builds from various publishers and build the game to play between my local computers, but that wasn't enough. Those builds had serious issues that I wanted to fix to maintain a more original version from when it was hosted on official servers, not private ones. That's why I planned to rebuild this C++ code to the latest C++ version and latest DirectX version. I even considered rebuilding it in .NET because the game isn't that resource-intensive to run since it's old, so it wouldn't be much of a performance bottleneck. .NET code would've been so much more readable. I spent many days analyzing the code and making some changes. I still wish to complete the idea of reviving and rebuilding this game one day."
